# Contributing to Antalya Examples

## Welcome
We gladly accept PRs and issues to improve this project. 

## Development Guidelines

1. Submit a GitHub issue if you want to discuss design prior to creating a pull request. 
2. Format files in accordance with the language 
conventions. 
3. Include tests. If there are existing tests extend them with new cases. Otherwise create automated tests. 
4. Keep documentation current. Update README.md files where needed to describe new behavior. 
5. Place Apache 2.0 header comments in Python files. 

## Testing Conventions

1. Use Python unittest to write tests. 
2. Write a docstring on the unit test class to decribe the test. 
3. Write a docstring on each test case method to document the proposition that it tests. 
4. Keep code as short as possible. Put repeated test code in helper functions. 
5. Dump all information needed to debug failures. 

## Use of AI tools

Feel free to use AI tools but add this file to the context by telling
your AI agent to follow these rules for design and code gen activities.
